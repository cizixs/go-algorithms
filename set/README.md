# Set

Set is a simple `set` data structure(all elements are unique) that implements the following behaviors:

- Add(x): add item x to set
- Remove(x): remove item from set
- Remove(x, y, z): remove multi items from set
- Pop(): remove and return an arbitrary item
- Copy(): create and return a new copy the original set
- Clear(): remove all items
- Size(): return how many elements are in set
- Contains(x): check if item exists in set
- Equal(other): check if two sets contains exactly same elements
- IsSubset(other): check if the other set is a subnet
- isSuperset(other): check if the other set is a superset
- Union(other): return a new set the is the contains all elements in either set
- Intersection(other): return a new set contains elements that are in both sets
- Difference(other): return a new set that contains elements which are in s not in other
- SymmetricDifference(other): return a new set that contains elements only in one set
